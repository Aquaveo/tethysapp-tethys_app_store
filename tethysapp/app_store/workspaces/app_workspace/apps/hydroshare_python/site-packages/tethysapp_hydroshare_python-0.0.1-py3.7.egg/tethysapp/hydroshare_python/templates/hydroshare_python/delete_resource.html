  <img src="{% static 'hydroshare_python/images/deleteresource.jpeg'%}" alt="Resource ID" height="200">

  <p>As shown above this feature in the app is to delete a Resource from your profile. The action is done to delete any unnecessary resources created. THIS IS A PERMANENT ACTION which would delete ALL files in the resource and it cannot be retrieved again. So be careful as a copy of the Resource will not be retained by HydroShare ! But this feature works smoothly without any glitches, just try copying the resource ID from the HTTP hyperlink when you open your resource in Hydroshare. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Below are step by step instructions on how to delete a resource:</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Sign into HydroShare using your credentials</h3>
  <form id="add-dam-form" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    
    {% csrf_token %}

    <p>In the boxes below you enter your HydroShare username and its password. If you have to make an HydroShare account, <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/sign-up/?next=">click here</a>.</p>
    {% if not loggedin %}
    {% gizmo username_input %}
    {% gizmo password_input %}
    {% else %}
    <h4> You are logged into HydroShare </h4>
    {% endif %}
  <p></p>
  <h3>Step 2: Enter in the Resource ID and delete the Resource</h3>
  <p>The resource ID is a unique identifier for every resource on HydroShare. You can find it by clicking on your resource in HydroShare, scrolling down to the “How to Cite” section, and copying the ID from the URL. This is an example hyperlink: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0/ from which The 32 letter combination at the end is called the resource ID. The resource ID from the example hyperlink is <mark>08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0</mark>. </p>

    <p></p>
    {% gizmo delete_button %}
    

  </form>
