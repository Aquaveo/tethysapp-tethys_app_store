Welcome to Tethys App Store's documentation!
================================================

The Tethys App Store is similar in concept to the iOS App Store for Apple mobile devices or the Google Play Store for Android mobile devices, but exclusively for Tethys Applications. The Tethys App Store aims to make web applications portable by packaging Tethys Applications as Python packages and hosting them on Miniconda repositories. The App Store includes an option for developers to contribute their applications by following a two-step work-flow within the App Store's user interface. The App Store's backend processes take care of all the heavy lifting to correctly prepare the code and make it available as an easily installable Miniconda package.
