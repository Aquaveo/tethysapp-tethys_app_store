Welcome to Tethys App Warehouse's documentation!
================================================

The Tethys App Warehouse is similar in concept to the iOS App Store for Apple mobile devices or the Google Play Store for Android mobile devices, but exclusively for Tethys Applications. The Tethys App Warehouse aims to make web applications portable by packaging Tethys Applications and hosting it on Miniconda repositories. The warehouse includes an option for developers to contribute their applications by following a two-step work-flow within the warehouse user interface, while the warehouse takes care of all the heavy lifting of correctly preparing the code and making it available as an easily installable Miniconda package.
