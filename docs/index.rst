Welcome to Tethys App Store's documentation!
================================================

The Tethys App Store is similar in concept to the iOS App Store for Apple mobile devices or the Google Play Store for Android mobile devices, but exclusively for Tethys Applications. The Tethys App Store aims to make web applications portable by packaging Tethys Applications and hosting it on Miniconda repositories. The app store includes an option for developers to contribute their applications by following a two-step work-flow within its user interface and takes care of all the heavy lifting of correctly preparing the code and making it available as an easily installable Miniconda package.
